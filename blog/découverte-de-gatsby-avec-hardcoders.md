## One Front-end to Rule Them All

Create blazing fast websites and apps **AND** harness the power of 2000+ plugins



#### Create a **complete website** in the time it usually takes to build a prototype

Build sites with the services you want, like Shopify, Stripe, and WordPress, quickly and easily with Gatsby’s 2000+ plugins. Integrate data from anywhere: APIs, databases, CMSs, static files — or multiple sources at once.



Gatsby loads only **critical** 1 parts of the page, so your site loads as fast as possible. Once loaded, Gatsby **prefetches** 2 resources for other pages so that clicking on the site feels incredibly fast. Gatsby lets teams focus on creating content-driven websites instead of worrying about performance.
